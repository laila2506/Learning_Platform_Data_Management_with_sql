***Learning Platform Data Management with SQL***

**Project Description**
The Learning Platform Data Management System is a SQL-based project designed to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve data related to online learning platforms. This project provides a structured database system to handle student enrollments, course details, instructor information, and progress tracking, ensuring smooth operations for an e-learning environment.

**Features**
**Student Management:** Store and manage student details, including personal information and enrollment history.

**Course Catalog:** Maintain a database of courses, including titles, descriptions, and instructor assignments.

**Enrollment System:** Track student enrollments and course completion status.

**Instructor Management:** Store instructor profiles and their assigned courses.

**Progress Tracking:** Monitor student progress, quiz scores, and certification status.

**Database Queries:** Execute complex SQL queries for reporting and analytics.

**Technologies Used**
**Database Management System:** MySQL
**SQL Concepts Implemented:**
**DDL (Data Definition Language):** Creating tables, relationships, and constraints.
**DML (Data Manipulation Language):** Insert, update, delete operations.
**Joins & Aggregations:** Querying data efficiently.
**Stored Procedures & Triggers:** Automating database actions.

**Database Schema Overview**
The project consists of multiple normalized tables to organize data efficiently:

Students (student_id, name, email, enrollment_date)
Courses (course_id, title, description, instructor_id)
Instructors (instructor_id, name, expertise)
Enrollments (enrollment_id, student_id, course_id, status, completion_date)
Progress (progress_id, student_id, course_id, quiz_score, completion_percentage)

This project serves as a strong example of SQL-based data management, providing a practical learning experience in database design, query execution, and performance optimization.
